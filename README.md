# toornamentNotifier

This is a basic Python script which consumes Toornaments web endpoints to gather data about matches and participants, with the goal of emailing players who have a match today.

To use it, all you need is Python 2.7.  No 3rd party libraries are used.  You will also need to get setup within Toornament, see their website for details.
